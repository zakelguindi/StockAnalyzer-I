Here is what my next steps should be: 
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. create an HTML and client-side JS with the basic functionality. I don't need it to communicate with server yet. 
functionality: 
    - have list of data 
    - have JSON templates made 
    - have buttons that don't work yet 
    - have JS and HTML files complete. 
    - UI shouldn't be nice but should be able to do basic functionaltiy on app. 
    - sections: 
        - enter ticker name (console.log result)
        - have "refresh prices" button. 
        - calculations section 
        -
